This C# console application, named "StarPattern," generates three different star patterns using nested loops. Each pattern represents a triangular formation of stars, and the number of rows in each pattern is adjustable.

Star Pattern Example 1:

This pattern creates a right-angled triangle of stars.
The outer loop (irow) iterates through the rows, and the inner loop (icol) prints stars for each column, incrementing the count with each row.
Star Pattern Example 2:

This pattern generates a square shape of stars.
It utilizes two loops, one for rows and another for columns, to create a grid of stars.
Star Pattern Example 3:

This pattern forms an inverted right-angled triangle of stars with leading spaces.
Three nested loops are used:
The first loop (i) handles rows.
The second loop (j) generates leading spaces based on the row number.
The third loop (k) prints stars based on the row number.
These star patterns demonstrate the use of nested loops for creating visually interesting patterns. The flexibility in adjusting the number of rows allows for variations in the size and shape of the patterns.
